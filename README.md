# Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model

Disclaimer: This model is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.


**Key Features:**

Scikit-learn Implementation:
This project harnesses the capabilities of the scikit-learn library, a versatile and widely-used machine learning toolkit in Python. The extensive functionality of scikit-learn facilitates the development of robust and efficient predictive models.

Binary Classification:
The model is structured as a binary classifier, where it predicts two possible outcomes: 1 for the presence of the disease and 0 for the absence. This simplifies the diagnostic process, providing a clear indication to aid healthcare practitioners.

Data Preprocessing:
The repository includes comprehensive data preprocessing steps to ensure that the input data is appropriately cleaned, transformed, and prepared for training the machine learning model. This is a crucial step to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability.

Feature Engineering:
Leveraging scikit-learn's feature engineering capabilities, the model is trained on relevant features extracted from the input data. Feature engineering is a key aspect of developing an effective predictive model, allowing it to capture essential patterns and relationships within the data.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the machine learning model is thoroughly evaluated using a range of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This ensures transparency and provides insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement.
